## Description

In this task, I am asked to create a code quiz from scratch. By using HTML,CSS and Javascript,
a simple quiz template was built and work smoothly.
THis work mainly focused on how to make javascript content to work to link up with classes & ids.
Techniques like timer countdown, links to another html to display highscore rank.
It's a tough task that requires lots of efforts and time to get it concept clear in mind, but yet it teaches so much
Improvements still needed for further usage.
